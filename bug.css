The following CSS code causes an unexpected layout issue in some browsers:

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
}

.item {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  background-color: blue;
}
```

The issue is that if the total width of the `.item` elements exceeds the width of the `.container`, the `space-between` justification will not work as expected. Instead, the items will either overflow the container or wrap onto multiple lines.
